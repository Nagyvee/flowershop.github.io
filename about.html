<p class="heading">Hi there, it's nice to meet you. We're best SA flowershop (Elon Flowershop).</p>
<p>We started our journey as EJ Florist, we have always and will always be for local artisans. In fact, our business was borne out of a passionate commitment to support local florists who were trying to compete on a larger scale, but sadly didn't have the resources.</p>
<p>Fast forward 4 years of nationwide gifting and fresh flower delivery, and here we are. To date, we've built meaningful relationships with over 200 artisans, empowering them to expand their businesses by using our tech marketplace as their online hub.</p>
<p>We initiated a Florist Empowerment Program and launched a service called Zoom Bloom that allows customers to order flowers and have them delivered within two hours in JHB, CPT, PTA and DBN. And while it's been an incredible journey so far, we're ready to evolve. Because we want more. More for our florists and artisans. More for our customers. More for our business. And more for the greater good of creating a sustainable, responsible gifting solution for the market.</p>

<p class="heading">So, here's what we're doing:</p>
<p>We don’t want to limit ourselves to flowers. We currently have a living, breathing business model and we want it to keep on growing with us. We’re redefining ourselves and opening a new chapter. We want everything we say and do to reflect our mission to enable our partners, our customers, and ourselves, to bloom.</p>

<div class="content-3">
    <h2>What makes us different?</h2>
    <p>We are committed to the ability to bloom, not only within our team, but in the communities we work with, the people we collaborate with and in crafting the best possible experience for our our customers.</p>
    <p> We are Elon. Let's be friends. </p>
